# Freshness-of-Produce
The freshness detection system leverages various technologies
Objective The primary goal of this project is to develop a system for assessing the freshness of produce using a combination of sensors, data analysis, and machine learning techniques. By accurately determining the freshness, we aim to reduce food waste, improve supply chain efficiency, and ensure high-quality produce for consumers.

Methodology including:

Sensor Technology: Integration of temperature, humidity, gas, and possibly color sensors to monitor the physical and chemical attributes of the produce. Data Analysis: Collection and processing of sensor data in real-time to establish patterns that indicate the degradation of freshness. Machine Learning Algorithms: Utilizing trained models to predict freshness based on sensor input. The models are fine-tuned for different types of produce. Backend Integration: A system to store data in a central server for tracking and predicting freshness over time, ensuring seamless communication between hardware and software components.
